# Overview

### Steps to automate any smart contract function:

To automate your smart contract, you will need to

1. A smart contract deployed that has a particular function you want to automate (e.g. a `harvest()` function
2. A condition that defines when that function should be executed (e.g. execute the function every 2 hours or every time a particular [Resolver](../guides/writing-a-resolver/) returns `true`)
3. Define how you want to pay for the transactions (e.g. with your Gelato balance)
4. Submit a task on the [Gelato Ops](https://app.gelato.network) UI
