### 1. Prepare your Smart contract to be automated

Find out the smart contract address and the function you would want to automate. There are a few restrictions that can prevent the function from being called by Gelato. Check out [here](../what-tasks-can-be-automated.md).

### 2. Define the condition

You can tell Gelato exactly when do you want your function to be called. For complex cases, you would need a resolver. Check out [here](../writing-a-resolver/).

### 3. Define your payment method

Gelato allows task creators to pay executors before or during the execution depending on their needs. Check out [here](../fee-payment-options.md).

### 4. Submitting your task

There are different ways for you to submit your task as well. Check out [here](../submitting-task/).
