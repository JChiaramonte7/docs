# Interactive Tutorial

![Click here to follow the tutorial (recommendation: do you on Polygon or GÃ¶rli)](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-11-04 at 4.19.02 PM.png>)

If you prefer a more interactive experience, please follow the Tutorial on the official [Gelato Ops](https://app.gelato.network) website. In this tutorial, you will get to mint a Gelato ice cream NFT which you can "lick", but only every 5 minutes, otherwise you get "brainfreeze".&#x20;

To accomplish this, you can create a task to automate this licking using Gelato in order to not having to do it manually yourself.&#x20;
