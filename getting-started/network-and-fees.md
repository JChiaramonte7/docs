# Network and fees

Gelato Ops are on these networks.

### Production

* Ethereum Mainnet
* Polygon/Matic
* Fantom
* Binance Smart Chain (coming soon)
* Arbitrum (coming soon)
* Avalanche (coming soon)

### Staging

* Ropsten&#x20;

* Goerli

### Fees

**UPDATE:** Until the end of 2021, Gelato charges **0% fees!**

Transactions on e.g. Ethereum are not free. Gelato executors pay the transaction fee to miners and thus need to get their costs refunded + a small incentive added to make it worth operating the infrastructure. The fee structure is as follows.

**Ethereum Mainnet** - Execution gas cost + 10%

**Polygon/Matic** -  Execution gas cost  + 100%

**All other networks** -  Execution gas cost  + 50%
